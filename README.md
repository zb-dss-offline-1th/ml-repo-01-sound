# Analysis
The code in this project provides a means of comparing two audio files through visualization to see their similarities and differences. A detailed description of how to implement the custom classes is provided in the `Untitled.ipynb`. 

For more information see the [documentation](https://www.google.com/).

## Requirements
In order to implement these classes, you will need the following packages installed in your environment:

* `numpy` 
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `librosa`
